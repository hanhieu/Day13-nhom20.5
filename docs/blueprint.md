## 5. Individual Contributions & Evidence

### Phan Anh Khôi - 2A202600276 (Member A)
- [TASKS_COMPLETED]: Implemented Correlation IDs middleware, enriched structured logs with context, and built the PII scrubber for sensitive data directly inside `app/logging_config.py` and `app/pii.py`.
- [EVIDENCE_LINK]: (Provide Link to commit or PR for Logging)

### Nguyễn Hữu Quang - 2A202600167 (Member B)
- [TASKS_COMPLETED]: Instrumented Langfuse tracing using the `@observe` decorator, tracked pipeline inputs/outputs, and propagated tags and metadata across application spans.
- [EVIDENCE_LINK]: (Provide Link to commit or PR for Tracing)

### Nguyễn Hữu Huy - 2A202600166 (Member C)
- [TASKS_COMPLETED]: Configured SLO targets (`config/slo.yaml`) and Alerting rules (`config/alert_rules.yaml`). Drafted runbook documentation in `docs/alerts.md` for incident response.
- [EVIDENCE_LINK]: (Provide Link to commit or PR for SLO & Alerts)

### Nguyễn Gia Bảo - 2A202600156 (Member D)
- [TASKS_COMPLETED]: Developed load testing scripts (`scripts/load_test.py`) to benchmark parallel bottlenecks and executed incident injection scenarios (`rag_slow`) to validate system observability.
- [EVIDENCE_LINK]: (Provide Link to commit or PR for Load Test & Incidents)

### Hàn Quang Hiếu - 2A202600056 (Member E)
- [TASKS_COMPLETED]: Built and configured the 6-panel frontend observability dashboard (`dashboard.html` and `dashboard.json`) mapping to `/metrics`. Collected metric evidence and screenshots for the report.
- [EVIDENCE_LINK]: (Provide Link to commit or PR for Dashboard)

### Nguyễn Bình Thành - 2A202600138 (Member F)
- [TASKS_COMPLETED]: Compiled the Blueprint report, synthesized the Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in the Incident Response section, and prepared the Demo script to showcase the system.
- [EVIDENCE_LINK]: (Provide Link to commit or PR for Blueprint)
